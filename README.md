# Brain Tumor Clasification - Deep Learning Model

This project presents a deep learning-based model for the early detection of brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The model leverages transfer learning with the EfficientNetV2-S architecture to classify MRI images into one of three tumor types: glioma, meningioma, or pituitary. The model achieved an impressive 99.45% test accuracy and was validated on an external dataset for robustness.
